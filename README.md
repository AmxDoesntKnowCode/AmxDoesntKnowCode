How to use!!!
so you need a text file that contians the passwords 
name that file "passlist.txt" and VERY IMPORTANT! The program and th file need to be in the same folder
or could be just in the desktop 

after that we need the ip
we can get the ip of somebody's machine via typing "ipconfig" in their cmd. in their cmd terminal you can find their router's name youre gonna aim for "ipv4 address" 
take that in boom you've got their ip!
once youv tricked them to do that you need their window's user name
you can get that in the ip getting step, when the person opens cmd its gonna look something like "C:\Users\*their username* "
so now you put these in the program and watch it go!
